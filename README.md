# BioHits
A Go toolkit for finding hot topics in biological and medical field.

## Description
Living in an era where findings in science and technology come out every single day, how to catch hot topics in the field of interest from tons of literature becomes an important problem. Also, when stepping into a new research area, we usually need to read some related papers, including classical ones and latest ones, to get a sense of what is it and what contributions can we make to this field. But carefully reading papers one by one requires much time and energy and sometimes we even don't need to know all the information in papers, maaybe some key words are sufficient for us to start.

To address this problem, here I present BioHits, a Go toolkit that can find hot topics for us automatically with just a few lines of code by scraping [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) iteratures, processing words in title and abstract, and doing some statistical summary.

It originally is a course project for 02601: Programming for Scientists, but I will continue making improvements and updates after finishing this course.
